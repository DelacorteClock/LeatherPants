# LeatherPants
## About
LeatherPants is a simple app with a purpose of allowing people to talk about contemporary clothing and design. It is designed to be minimal and easy to use.
## How To Start
(Expo on your phone or emulater is required.) You will need to download the zip of this repository (creation of TheLeathers), extract to a new folder, do npm instal and then use Expo CLI there to run expo start. You will then get a barcode which you can scan with a phone or emulater to start the app. You will need to create a google firebase and firestore project to customise. You can do this in the config for firebase in the App.js file.
## How To Use
To start conversing you must type a display name in the start screen. You can then choose a colour theme if you desire to do so. Here is the start screen before and after user choices got inputted:

After you click 'GO' you will go to the page where you can communicate.
## Technology Credits
I used React Native and Expo for the creation of this app. Firebase and Firestore were used for saving information about messages and their contents. The Android Emulater system was used for testing.
