# LeatherPants
## About
LeatherPants is a simple app with a purpose of allowing people to talk about contemporary clothing and design. It is designed to be minimal and easy to use.
## How To Use
To start conversing you must type a display name in the start screen. You can then choose a colour theme if you desire to do so. Here is the start screen before and after user choices got inputted:

After you click 'GO' you will go to the page where you can talk...this page is currently empty and will just reveal your name and theme preference.
